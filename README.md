tutorial - vanilla JS drag and drop file uploader
I followed the tutorial at https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/01/drag-drop-file-uploader-vanilla-js/ and decided to make a git repo for it as it may come in handy to clone into future projects.

for the image uploading I used npm upload-test-server

    $ npm install -g upload-test-server
    $ upload-test-server start 

then made th upload url:

    http://localhost:8989/upload
